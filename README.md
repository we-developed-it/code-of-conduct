# We Developed It Code of Conduct

## When Something Happens
If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s).
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
3. If this doesn’t happen, or if you're uncomfortable speaking up, contact admins.
4. As soon as available, an admin will join, identify themselves, and take further action (see below), starting with a warning, then temporary deactivation, then long-term or permanent deactivation.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

We Developed It slack prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The needs of the most vulnerable in any given situation will be prioritized.

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members of the We Developed It community pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, technical preferences, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of "outing" of any aspect of someone's identity without their consent.
* Publishing slack screenshots or quotes, especially from identity channels, without all quoted users' explicit consent.
* Publishing or telling others that a member belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
* Publishing of non-harassing private communication.
* Any of the above even when [presented as "ironic" or "joking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism).
* Any attempt to present [reverse discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_discrimination) versions of the above as violations for the purpose of derailing discussions of other violations. For example, [reverse racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_racism) or [reverse sexism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Reverse_sexism).
* Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn't already know it. Ask before you teach! Don't assume what people's knowledge gaps are.
* [Feigning or exaggerating surprise](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise) when someone admits to not knowing something.
* ["Well-actuallies"](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in other spaces involving the community. This includes the We Developed It Slack, private email communications in the context of the community, and any events where members of the community are participating, as well as adjacent communities and venues affecting the community's members.

Depending on the violation, the admins may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

## Admin Enforcement Process
Once the admins get involved, they will follow a documented series of steps and do their best to preserve the well-being of We Developed It members.

## Contacting Admins
You may get in touch with the We Developed It admin team by directly messaging them in private. Feel free to message multiple admins in case you do not get a response from someone.

The admins are (alphabetical order): Megan Boczar (@megan.boczar.a2), Kelli Dore (@Kelli), Talya Flowers-Souley (@talya.flowers.dayton/cincinnati), Rita Hill (@rita), Sylvia Pellicore (@Sylvia), Kristen Seversky (kristen.seversky.roc), Angel Thomas (@Angel)
 
## Further Enforcement
If you've already followed the initial enforcement steps, these are the steps admins will take for further enforcement, as needed:

1. Repeat the request to stop.
2. If the person doubles down, they will be removed from the channel and given an official warning.
3. If the behavior continues or is repeated later, the person will be deactivated for 24 hours.
4. If the behavior continues or is repeated after the temporary deactivation, a long-term (6-12mo) or permanent deactivation will be used.

On top of this, admins may remove any offending messages, images, contributions, etc, as they deem necessary.

Admins reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, at their discretion, if the violation is considered to be a serious and/or immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the community. These include any threats, serious physical or verbal attacks, and other such behavior that would be completely unacceptable in any social setting that puts our members at risk. Depending on severity, violations of this code of conduct within private channels where the purpose is protecting the safety of those there, for example safe spaces for marginalized people, can result in immediate expulsion from that channel. That said, we're all learning and we will make mistakes so use them as teachable moments to do better in the future.

## Who Watches the Watchers?
Admins and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community's leadership. These may include anything from removal from the admin team to a permanent ban from the community.

## Administrative Decisions
Whenever a significant administrative decision needs to be made, all admins will be pinged by whichever admin has proposed the action. The action will not be taken until all available admins (at least three) have offered their opinions. This requirement may be skipped in an emergency, as defined by any admin, but in that case a discussion must still take place afterwards, potentially reversing the decision. Any disagreement which cannot be resolved by discussion between admins regarding a decision will lead to a vote, with a simple majority of available admins (at least three) being required to take the proposed action.

## Enforcement Examples

### The Best Case
The vast majority of situations work out like this, in our experience. This interaction is common, and generally positive.

```
Alex: "Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!"

Patt: "Hey, could you not use that word? What about 'ridiculous' instead?"

Alex: "oh sorry, sure." -> edits old message to say "it was really confusing!"
```


### The Admin Case
Sometimes, though, you need to get admins involved. Admins will do their best to resolve conflicts, but people who were harmed by something will take priority.

```
Patt: "Honestly, sometimes I just really hate using $library and anyone who uses it probably sucks at their job."

Alex: "Whoa there, could you dial it back a bit? There's a CoC thing about attacking folks' tech use like that."

Patt: "I'm not attacking anyone, are you deaf?"

Alex: " hey uh. Can someone look at #javascript? Patt is getting a bit aggro. I tried to nudge them about it, but nope."

MxAdmin1: <joins #javascript> "Hey Patt, admin here. Could you tone it down? This sort of attack is really not okay in this space."

Patt: "Leave me alone I haven't said anything bad wtf is wrong with you."

MxAdmin1: "/remove @patt", "/msg @patt I mean it. Please refer to the CoC linked at https://github.com/we-developed-it/code-of-conduct if you have questions, but you can consider this an actual warning. I'd appreciate it if you reworded your messages in #javascript, since they made folks there uncomfortable. Let's try and be kind, yeah?"

Patt: "/msg @mxadmin1 Okay sorry. I'm just frustrated and I'm kinda burnt out and I guess I got carried away. I'll DM Alex a note apologizing and edit my messages. Sorry for the trouble."

MxAdmin1: "/msg @patt Thanks for that. I hear you on the stress. Burnout sucks :/. Have a good one!"
```
